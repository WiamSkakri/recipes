    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound cooked, shredded turkey</li>
        <li>6 ounces shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>24 small white corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 egg white, to seal flautas (optional)</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded napa cabbage</li>
        <li>¾ cup guacamole</li>
        <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup salsa</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps To Prepare </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix shredded turkey, pepper Jack cheese, green onions, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Wrap a stack of tortillas in a paper towel and place them in a sealable plastic bag. Microwave on high for about 45 seconds until the tortillas are hot and flexible. Keep tortillas warm in the bag as you fill them.</li>
        <li>Place 2 tortillas on a work surface, overlapping slightly to create a longer tortilla. Spoon about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the turkey mixture onto the tortillas below the centerline.</li>
        <li>Paint a bit of egg white along the top edge of the tortillas to seal. Roll the tortillas tightly from the bottom edge over the filling and set them aside seam-side down while filling the remaining tortillas.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch of vegetable oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Once hot, place the flautas seam-side down in the oil and press gently with a spatula to flatten.</li>
        <li>Fry in batches for 3 to 4 minutes per side, until crispy, golden, and heated through. Drain on paper towels for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Serve flautas topped with shredded napa cabbage, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
