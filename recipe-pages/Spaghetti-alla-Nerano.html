    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> 
        Spaghetti alla Nerano is the ultimate ode to simplicity, 
        offering a delicate harmony of flavors that transform humble zucchini 
        into an unforgettable culinary experience. This dish, popularized by Stanley Tucci’s
         passionate praise in Searching for Italy, combines perfectly fried zucchini with al 
         dente spaghetti, creamy butter, and the rich, salty tang of Pecorino 
         Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. The zucchini is deep-fried 
         to golden perfection, creating a sweet, nutty flavor that pairs beautifully 
         with fresh basil and a touch of pasta water to form a luscious, silky sauce. 
         With just a handful of ingredients and a little patience, Spaghetti alla Nerano 
         delivers a luxurious meal that highlights the magic of thoughtful cooking. 
         Whether you’re enjoying garden-fresh zucchini or picking them up at the market, 
         this dish promises to be a crowd-pleaser that’s as comforting as it is elegant.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        
            <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
            <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps to Prepare </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.</li>
        <li>Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.</li>
        <li>Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
